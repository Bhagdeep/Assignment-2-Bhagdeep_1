        Challenges:
          i had trouble with a lot of small detail stuff. Some parts of the assignment wouldn't
            turn out the way i wanted it to and it ended up only looking somewhat similar.
            For example moving the search bar and the red bell to the right of the screen
            no matter what i did it wouldnt move hover. I also couldnt figure out how to make the text for the author and navbar a
            different color. I kinda ended up just leaving it and changing the background of both of them when a cursor hovers over them.

          Learned:
          i learned more about the structure of a website. Being able to apply to CSS code yourself helps
          understand the code that goes into it. I also learned how frustrating it can be.

          Resources:
          I used to lecture vidoes, notes from the lecture, as well as some outside sources for small
          problems.

          Google:
            The sizing issues for the boxes, which i wasnt really able to figure out. As well as
            having the tweeter entries change with the size of the window. I wasnt able to figure these out though
            Lastly just the resizing of the red bell to make it look bigger when hovering over the button.
